Explanation of the Code in Frama-C

This document provides a step-by-step explanation of the ACSL-annotated C function used in Exercise 5 (Section 9.3), including how it works and behaves under verification.

1. Used Library
---------------------
#include <limits.h>
 - This library provides constants that define the limits of integer data types, such as:

  INT_MIN: the minimum value that a variable of type int can take.
 
  INT_MAX: the maximum value that a variable of type int can take.
  

2. Step Function
---------------------

void step(int *i, int *j);
 - The function "step" takes two integer pointers and modifies the integers they point to.
 - It increases *i by 2 and *j by 3.
 

3. Pointer Validity Preconditions
--------------------
requires \valid(i) && \valid(j);
 - Ensures that both 'i' and 'j' are valid pointers before any dereferencing occurs.
 - Prevents undefined behavior.
 

4. Overflow Protection Preconditions
-------------------
requires INT_MIN + 3 <= *j && *j <= INT_MAX - 3;
 - Ensures that *j can safely be incremented by 3 without overflow or underflow.

requires INT_MIN + 2 <= *i && *i <= INT_MAX - 2;
 - Ensures that *i can safely be incremented by 2 without overflow or underflow.
 

5. Precondition Given in the Exercise
--------------------
requires (*i) * (*j) + 2 * (*j) + 3 * (*i) == 0;
 - This is a specific algebraic condition from Exercise 5.
 - It ensures that after incrementing *i by 2 and *j by 3, the resulting product will be exactly 6.
 

6. Assignment Clause
--------------------
assigns *i, *j;
 - Specifies that only the memory addressed by "i" and "j" will be modified by this function.
 

7. Postcondition
--------------------
ensures (\old(*i) + 2) * (\old(*j) + 3) == 6;
 - Ensures that the post state values of *i and *j satisfy the desired result.
 - \old() refers to the value before the function was executed.
 

8. Function Body
--------------------
*j = *j + 3;
 - Modifies the value at pointer j by adding 3.

*i = *i + 2;
 - Modifies the value at pointer i by adding 2.
 

9. Expected Results at the WSL(Windows Subsystem for Linux) terminal

The output indicates that:

1. The ACSL contract is correct (all targets checked).
2. There are no runtime errors detected by RTE.
3. The code is safe, terminates, and complies with the logical specifications.
